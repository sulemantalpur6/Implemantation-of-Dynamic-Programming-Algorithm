This project introduced the implementation of dynamic programming algorithms .There are many dynamic programming algorithms used and implemented to get a feasible and optimal 
solution of the problems. Some them algorithms which are implemented in the project are written below.

1.Longest Common Subsequence
When a sequence of string is derived from the string and all of the elements which are in the main string have the same order its known as subsequence of the string. 
Longest Common Subsequence is the longest sequence of all possible sequence which we get from the sequence. Longest Common Subsequence gives the longest sequence derives
out from the all possible subsequence of the string. For this Dynamic Programming approach is used to give the optimal solution.

2.Shortest Common Supersequence
Shortest Common Supersequence gives us the matching sequence from the string in which both of the original strings exist as a subsequence of the given two strings. 
The subsequence string has orders of letters something like that all it occur the both strings with minimal letters. Basically, it considers the matching letter of the
both string as a single letter and put the order of these letter in a manner from which both strings can be obtained. Dynamic Programming Approach is used to find the minimal 
solution and the minimal subsequence from the two string.

3.Levenshtein Distance
Levenshtein Distance also known as edit-distance is used to find the minimum edit distance for converting the one string into 2nd string. By Dynamic Programming Approach to convert 
one string into second string it checks some condition that weather the letter needs to delete, replace or insert. By checking all these conditions, it converts the one string into 
second string in optimal time and give the feasible solution.  

4.Longest Increasing Subsequence
The Longest Increasing Subsequence is a subsequence within an array of numbers with an increasing order. The numbers within the subsequence have to be unique and in an 
ascending manner. Longest Increasing Subsequence have and subsequence of an array which increases as we iterate. By using Dynamic Programming Approach, we get the longest 
subsequence in just couple of times.
 
5.Matrix Chain Multiplication (Order finding / paranthesization)
Matrix Chain Multiplication is hard problem to be solve in leaner time but by using the approach of Dynamic Programming it will cost less time and give feasible solution by sorting 
its parentheses in manner that it will give use minimum cost of multiplication is an optimization problem.

6."0-1" Knapsack Problem
In 0-1 Knapsack Problem we are given a set of items and each with a weight and we have to find the number of each item or piece to include in a group so that total weight of the 
item is less than or equal to a given limit. Since this is a maximization problem it can be solved using dynamic programming

7.Partition-problem
Here we divide array in equal partition and calculate the sum of the both partition if the sum is equal its great but some time the partition. By using Dynamic Programming Approach,
the algorithm will divide the array in two partition that its sum will always be equal.

8.Rod Cutting Problem
Rod Cutting Problem is same as like as 0-1 Knapsack Problem in Knapsack we have given weights and get a collection of these weights which will be equal to the limit weight. 
Here we are given set of rod lengths and its value we have to cut the rod in a way such that total value is maximum and will also be equal to the given rod limit. It will easily 
solve by the Dynamic Programming Approach.

9.Coin-change-making-problem
In coin change problem we are provided the coins with different denominations like Rs.1, Rs.3, Rs.7 and etc. and we have to make and amount by using these coins in such a way that
we used minimum number of coins. The coin change problem efficiently solves by the dynamic programming approach. 

10.Word Break Problem
In this problem multiple words are given like dictionary of words are given and we have to find that the given string sequence would be broken up into the words in this dictionary 
or not. The word break problem will solve by Dynamic Programming Approach in very efficient time.
